Hackathon By SRM<br>
->In round 1, we have given an idea that our software will perform a validation test by checking the system's IP address, hostname and govt authorized license.<br>
->As per our idea, we have implemented the same.<br>
->For now i have given my system's IP address, so this software will work only in my system.<br>
->In our project, first we have collected user's IP address and hostname automatically by our software and checked it's validation that either the IP address is valid for acccessing the data or not.<br>
->At last, we have collected the govt authorised license by the user and again checked it with the user's IP address and host name.<br>
->Therefore, we have three levels of security during validation.<br>
->In our IP application that is in .exe form, first it checks IP address and host name automatically then user need to input it's govt_authorized license.<br>
->After checking all these validations it will open website in my case, but you can open any database, software or anything.
